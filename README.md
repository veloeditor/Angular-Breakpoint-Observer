# Angular-Breakpoint-Observer

This app will be a place where I build some examples of how Angular's Breakpoint Observer can be beneficial in creating mobile-ready applications. This app will work with the breakpointObserver in at least three ways:
1. Through a custom directive
2. Directly within a component
3. Through a service
